# EFS â€“ Elastic File System

## What is Amazon EFS?
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a fully managed, scalable, and elastic file storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances. EFS provides simple, scalable, and elastic file storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.

## Key Features
1. **Scalable**: Automatically scales your file system storage up or down as you add or remove files without disrupting your applications.
2. **Elastic**: Provides elastic storage capacity, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files.
3. **Fully Managed**: Reduces the complexity of managing a file system, letting AWS handle the provisioning and management of the infrastructure.
4. **High Availability and Durability**: Designed to provide high availability and durability by replicating data across multiple Availability Zones.
5. **Performance Modes**: Offers different performance modes (General Purpose and Max I/O) and throughput modes (Bursting and Provisioned) to optimize for various use cases.

## Use Cases
1. **Content Management**: Ideal for content repositories, web serving, and media workflows.
2. **Home Directories**: Provides scalable and highly available storage for user home directories.
3. **Big Data Analytics**: Suitable for big data and analytics workloads that require high throughput and low latency.
4. **Backup and Restore**: Acts as a durable and scalable storage solution for backup and restore operations.

## How to Use Amazon EFS
1. **Create a File System**: Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs to create an EFS file system.
2. **Mount Targets**: Create mount targets in the VPC for the file system.
3. **Mount the File System**: Mount the EFS file system to your EC2 instances using the NFSv4 protocol.
4. **Read and Write Data**: Access and manage your data just like you would with a local file system.
