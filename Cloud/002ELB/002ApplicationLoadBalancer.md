# Application Load Balancer (ALB)

## What is an Application Load Balancer?
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a service provided by AWS that distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. ALB operates at the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model), which allows it to make routing decisions based on content of the request.

## Key Features
1. **Content-Based Routing**: Route requests to different target groups based on URL path, host headers, HTTP headers, and method.
2. **WebSockets and HTTP/2**: Support for WebSockets and HTTP/2, enabling real-time applications and improved performance.
3. **SSL Termination**: Offload SSL/TLS termination from your instances to the load balancer to manage encryption centrally.
4. **Health Checks**: Continuously monitors the health of registered targets and ensures that traffic is only routed to healthy instances.
5. **Security**: Integration with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect your applications from common web exploits and vulnerabilities.

## Use Cases
1. **Microservices**: Distribute traffic across multiple services and scale them independently.
2. **Web Applications**: Provide high availability and load balancing for web applications.
3. **Containerized Applications**: Integrate with Amazon ECS and Kubernetes for load balancing containerized applications.

## How to Set Up an Application Load Balancer
1. **Create an ALB**: Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs to create an ALB.
2. **Configure Listeners**: Define how the ALB listens for incoming connections (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS).
3. **Define Rules**: Set up rules to route traffic based on URL path, host headers, HTTP headers, and methods.
4. **Register Targets**: Add targets (e.g., EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions) to target groups.
5. **Configure Health Checks**: Set up health checks to monitor the health of your targets.

```

### Description of the Flow Diagram
- Incoming Traffic: User requests or application traffic enter the Application Load Balancer.
- Application Load Balancer: The ALB evaluates the traffic based on predefined rules.
- Evaluate Rules: The ALB evaluates content-based routing rules to determine where to route the traffic.
- Route to Target Groups: Based on the evaluation, the ALB routes the traffic to the appropriate target groups.
- Target Group: The target group consists of multiple targets (e.g., EC2 instances), where the ALB distributes the traffic to ensure even load and high availability.
