# Network Load Balancer (NLB)

## Overview
A Network Load Balancer (NLB) operates at Layer 4 of the OSI model and is designed to handle high-performance traffic with low latency. It forwards TCP and UDP traffic to your instances and is suitable for applications requiring extreme performance and reliability.

## Key Features
- **Protocol Support**: NLB can forward both TCP and UDP traffic to your instances.
- **High Performance**: Capable of handling millions of requests per second.
- **Low Latency**: Provides lower latency (~100 ms) compared to Application Load Balancer (~400 ms).
- **Static IP**: NLB has one static IP per Availability Zone (AZ) and supports assigning Elastic IPs, which is beneficial for whitelisting specific IP addresses.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications requiring extreme performance and high throughput, especially those utilizing TCP or UDP traffic.
- **AWS Free Tier**: Not included in the AWS free tier.

## Usage
Network Load Balancers are commonly used in scenarios where high performance and low latency are critical, such as real-time data streaming, gaming, financial transactions, and other latency-sensitive applications.
