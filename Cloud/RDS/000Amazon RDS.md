- **RDS** stands for Relational Database Service.
- It’s a managed database service for databases that use SQL as a query language.
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS.

### Supported Database Engines
- **Postgres**
- **MySQL**
- **MariaDB**
- **Oracle**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **IBM DB2**
- **Aurora** (AWS Proprietary database)

## Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)


### Key Features and Benefits

1. **Managed Service**:
   - **Automated Provisioning**: AWS handles the setup and configuration of the database.
   - **OS Patching**: RDS automatically applies OS patches to ensure the system is up-to-date and secure.

2. **Automated Backups**:
   - **Continuous Backups**: RDS continuously backs up your database and allows you to restore to any point in time within the backup retention period.
   - **Point in Time Restore**: You can restore your database to any specific time within the backup retention window.

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - **Monitoring Dashboards**: RDS provides performance insights and monitoring dashboards to track database performance.
   - **Maintenance Windows**: Predefined windows for applying updates and upgrades without manual intervention.

4. **High Availability and Durability**:
   - **Multi-AZ Deployments**: RDS can be deployed in multiple availability zones for high availability and disaster recovery.
   - **Automatic Failover**: In case of an instance failure, RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another availability zone.

5. **Read Replicas**:
   - **Improved Read Performance**: You can create read replicas to offload read traffic from the primary database instance.
   - **Scalability**: Read replicas can be scaled to handle increased read workloads.

6. **Scalability**:
   - **Vertical Scaling**: Easily scale the instance size up or down based on workload requirements.
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Use read replicas to distribute read traffic and improve performance.

7. **Storage Options**:
   - **EBS-backed Storage**: RDS uses Elastic Block Store (EBS) for storage, offering options like General Purpose (gp2) and Provisioned IOPS (io1) for performance.

8. **Security**:
   - **Network Isolation**: Deploy your RDS instances in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation.
   - **Encryption**: Data can be encrypted at rest and in transit using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

### Example Use Cases

- **Web Applications**: Use RDS to manage the backend databases for web applications, ensuring high availability and scalability.
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Leverage RDS for reliable and scalable databases to handle transactions and customer data.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Use read replicas and powerful database engines to support analytical queries and reporting.

## Advantage of Using RDS Versus Deploying DB on EC2

### RDS is a Managed Service:
- **Automated provisioning and OS patching**
- **Continuous backups and restore to a specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)**
- **Monitoring dashboards**
- **Read replicas for improved read performance**
- **Multi AZ setup for Disaster Recovery (DR)**
- **Maintenance windows for upgrades**
- **Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)**
- **Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)**

### Note:
- **You can’t SSH into your instances**
