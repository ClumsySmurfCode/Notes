## Designs to handle the scenario where a backend call fails due to the microservice being busy:

### Exponential Backoff with Retry:
- Implement an exponential backoff strategy for retries, which increases the delay between retries exponentially. This is useful to avoid overwhelming the microservice.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern:
- Use a circuit breaker pattern to prevent retrying when the service is known to be down. This helps in avoiding further strain on the service and can trigger a fallback mechanism.

### Fallback Mechanism:
- Provide a fallback mechanism to handle the situation when the service is unavailable. This could be returning a cached response or a default response.

### Rate Limiting:
- Implement client-side rate limiting to reduce the number of requests sent to the microservice. This can help prevent the service from being overwhelmed.

### Bulkhead Pattern:
- Isolate critical resources to prevent a failure in one part of the system from affecting the whole system. This helps in managing resource utilization effectively.
