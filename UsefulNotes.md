# Use Alpine Linux as the base image
-- 
Creating a minified Linux image for Docker typically involves starting with a base image and then removing unnecessary components to reduce the image size. Below is a basic example using Alpine Linux, which is known for its small size. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

"FROM alpine:latest"


# Remove unnecessary packages
RUN apk --no-cache del curl wget \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

Restart your computer.
Make sure Docker is not running. If it is trying to start, then stop it and close it.
Open your Applications folder and delete Docker, then empty the Trash (or brew uninstall docker).
Download Docker Desktop again, and copy Docker to your /Applications folder (or brew install --cask docker).
Once Docker is installed, open it and try starting the Docker daemon.
