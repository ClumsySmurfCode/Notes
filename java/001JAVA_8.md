## JAVA 8 
Java 8 introduced several significant features, especially in terms of functional programming. Here's an overview of some key features that are important for interview preparation:

### Stream

### Lambda Expressions:
Lambda expressions provide a concise way to express instances of single-method interfaces (functional interfaces). They introduce functional programming constructs to Java.

      Example: (a, b) -> a + b

### Functional Interfaces:
An interface with a single abstract method is called a functional interface. The @FunctionalInterface annotation can be used to ensure that the interface has only one abstract method.

        Example:
        @FunctionalInterface
        public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
            int doSomething(int a, int b);
        }
### Streams:
The Stream API allows you to process collections of data in a functional style. It includes methods like filter, map, reduce, and more.

        Example:
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        int sum = numbers.stream()
                        .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                        .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                        .sum();

### Default Methods:
Default methods allow you to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. Classes can now inherit methods from interfaces.

        Example:
        interface MyInterface {
            default void myDefaultMethod() {
                System.out.println("Default method");
            }
        }

### Method References:
Method references provide a shorthand notation for lambda expressions when calling a method.
        
        Example:
        // Using lambda expression
        list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
        
        // Using method reference
        list.forEach(System.out::println);

### Optional:
Optional is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. It helps to avoid NullPointerException.

        Example:
        Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(getName());

### New Date and Time API:
The java.time package provides a comprehensive set of classes for handling date and time.

        Example:
        LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
        
### Nashorn JavaScript Engine:
Java 8 includes a new JavaScript engine called Nashorn, which provides 2 to 10 times better performance, as well as a more powerful API.

### Parallel Streams:
The Stream API also provides parallel processing of collections, making it easier to take advantage of multi-core processors.

### Collectors:
The Collectors class provides several utility methods for working with streams, especially useful for converting a stream into a collection or a single value.
