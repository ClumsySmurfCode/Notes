In Java, the standard library provides a variety of data structures that cover a wide range of use cases. Here are some advanced data structures in Java:

### HashMap:
HashMap is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the Map interface. It provides key-value pairs, allowing fast retrieval and insertion of data. The time complexity for basic operations (get and put) is O(1) on average.

### TreeMap:
TreeMap is another implementation of the Map interface but maintains the keys in sorted order. It is based on a Red-Black Tree and provides O(log n) time complexity for basic operations.

### HashSet:
HashSet is an implementation of the Set interface that uses a hash table for storage. It provides constant-time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains.

### TreeSet:
TreeSet is an implementation of the SortedSet interface and uses a Red-Black Tree for storage. It maintains the elements in sorted order, providing O(log n) time complexity for basic operations.

### LinkedHashMap:
LinkedHashMap is a subclass of HashMap that maintains the order of elements based on their insertion. It combines the features of a hash table and a linked list, offering O(1) time complexity for basic operations.

### PriorityQueue:
PriorityQueue is an implementation of a priority queue based on a priority heap. It orders elements according to their natural order or a specified comparator. Basic operations like insertion and removal of the highest-priority element have O(log n) time complexity.

### LinkedList:
LinkedList is a doubly-linked list implementation that allows fast insertions and removals at both ends. It implements the List interface and provides O(1) time complexity for adding or removing elements from the beginning or end.
Stack and Queue (java.util package):

The Stack class represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack of elements. The Queue interface represents a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue. Java provides various implementations like LinkedList and ArrayDeque for these data structures.

### ConcurrentHashMap:
ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe version of HashMap. It allows concurrent access to different segments of the map, providing high concurrency for read and write operations.
Trie:

While Java doesn't have a built-in trie implementation, you can create your own trie data structure to efficiently store and retrieve strings, especially for tasks involving prefix matching.
Graphs:

For representing graphs, you may use custom classes or libraries like JGraphT or Apache Commons Graph.
