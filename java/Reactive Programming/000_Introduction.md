# Reactive Programming in Java

## Diagram Explanation

The provided diagram outlines the key concepts and components of reactive programming in Java:

1. **Reactive Programming**: The core concept, which emphasizes handling data streams and propagating changes.
2. **RxJava The Big Picture**: An overview of RxJava, which is a Java VM implementation of Reactive Extensions (ReactiveX) for composing asynchronous and event-based programs.
3. **RxJava Reactive Streams**: These are the sequences of data or events that RxJava can handle, providing a way to work with asynchronous streams of data.
4. **Reactive Manifesto**: A document that outlines the principles of reactive programming, emphasizing responsiveness, resiliency, elasticity, and message-driven communication.
5. **Sync vs Async**: Understanding the differences between synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) operations.
6. **Callback Hell**: The issue of managing multiple nested callbacks in asynchronous programming, which reactive programming aims to simplify.
7. **Push vs Pull**: Two models of data flow where "push" means data is sent to a receiver when available, and "pull" means data is requested by the receiver.
8. **Observer Design Pattern**: A design pattern where an object (the subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them of state changes.
9. **Concurrent vs Parallel Programming**: Understanding the difference between concurrency (dealing with multiple tasks at the same time) and parallelism (executing multiple tasks simultaneously).

## Learning Roadmap

- Understand the various types of Observables and their use cases.

### 4. Working with Operators
- Study the different operators provided by RxJava for transforming, filtering, and combining observables.
- Practice using operators like `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `zip`.

### 5. Handling Asynchronous Data Streams
- Learn how to create and manage asynchronous data streams using RxJava.
- Understand the differences between `Single`, `Maybe`, `Completable`, and `Flowable`.
