### In RxJava, Flowable and Observable are both used for asynchronous programming and handling streams of data, but they differ primarily in how they handle backpressure.

### `Observable`
Observable is the basic unit in RxJava. It emits a stream of data (items) to its subscribers. It is suitable for scenarios where the producer (Observable) and the consumer (subscriber) operate at the same speed or where backpressure is not a concern.
Example:
```java
Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.range(1, 1000);

observable.subscribe(
    item -> System.out.println("Received: " + item),
    error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
);
```
##### In this example:

Observable.range(1, 1000) emits integers from 1 to 1000.
subscribe method is used to subscribe to the Observable. It takes three lambda expressions: one for receiving each item (item -> ...), one for error handling (error -> ...), and one for completion notification (() -> ...).


### `Flowable`
Flowable is introduced in RxJava to handle scenarios where the producer emits data faster than the consumer can process it, leading to potential overflow issues (backpressure). Flowable provides support for backpressure by implementing the Reactive Streams Publisher interface, which allows it to handle large datasets more efficiently.
Example:
```java
Flowable.range(1, 1000)
    .observeOn(Schedulers.computation())
    .subscribe(
        item -> System.out.println("Received: " + item),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );
```
##### In this example:

Flowable.range(1, 1000) emits integers from 1 to 1000.
observeOn(Schedulers.computation()) specifies that the processing should happen on the computation scheduler, which is suitable for CPU-bound tasks.
subscribe method works the same as with Observable, handling items, errors, and completion.

### Key Differences
Backpressure Handling: Flowable supports backpressure via mechanisms like onBackpressureBuffer, onBackpressureDrop, etc., whereas Observable doesn't have built-in backpressure support.
Use Cases: Flowable is typically used in scenarios where you deal with high-volume data streams and need to handle backpressure effectively. Observable is suitable for smaller datasets or situations where backpressure is not a concern.
